One of the things many people dislike about turkey is that is often too dry — by the time the legs and thighs (the best part) are done cooking, the breast is overdone. Spatchcocking (also known as butterflying) a bird, by removing the backbone, will yield a juicier, crispier final product. And because you are exposing more surface area to direct heat, the turkey will cook in considerably less time — about 90 minutes versus a few hours.

When you buy your turkey, have your butcher butterfly it for you. (If they cannot, for whatever reason, see instructions in the “go for it” version of this recipe.)

<strong>Ingredients</strong>
<ul>
  <li>1 fresh turkey
  <li>Kosher salt
  <li>Assorted vegetables, such as celery, onion, carrot (optional)
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>The night before you plan to roast the turkey, salt it using kosher salt. Make it rain a generous but even amount of salt covering the entire bird — the bird should be well-coated but not encrusted. 

  <li>Leave the salted turkey in the refrigerator overnight, then pull it out a few hours ahead of roasting and place on the kitchen counter to allow it to temper, which will allow a more even cooking.

  <li>Place the turkey, spread out flat, on a roasting rack over a sheet pan. If you want, you can chop vegetables, such as onions, celery and carrot to place under the rack and catch the drippings. Use these vegetables for your gravy or stuffing, if you like.
 
  <li>Roast in a 400-degree oven for about 90 minutes — or until the breast reads 140 degrees and the legs read 150 degrees. Remove from the oven and let rest for one hour — the bird should continue to cook and reach an internal temperature of 150 degrees for the breast and 160 degrees for the legs. 
 
  <li>Carve and serve!
</ol>
