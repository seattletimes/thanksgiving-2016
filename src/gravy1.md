<em>Serves 6-8</em>
 
<strong>For the chicken brodo base:</strong>
<ul>
  <li>1 gallon chicken stock, strained (this can be a homemade stock or store-bought; no bouillon!)
  <li>2 bone-in chicken thighs, skin and fat removed
  <li>2-6 ounces rind of Parmigiano-Reggiano
  <li>2 sprigs thyme
  <li>2 flat leaf parsley stems
  <li>½ medium yellow onion, cut in half, skin on
</ul>
 
<ol>
  <li>In a heavy sauce pot, heat stock, chicken thighs, cheese rinds, thyme, parsley and onion. Bring to a simmer. Skim impurities off the top and continue to cook at a low simmer for two hours. Skim off the top often.
  <li>Remove from heat and strain.  
  <li>Heat strained liquid over medium to medium-high heat and reduce to a simmer. Reduce the stock to approximately 1 ½  to 2 cups, about another hour. The liquid should be thickened, delicious and dark amber in color.
  <li>If it seems thick, you can add stock and continue to reduce, or adjust in the future. 
  <li>This sauce can be refrigerated or frozen at this stage, or turned into your finished sauce.
</ol>
 
<strong>For the finished gravy:</strong>
<ul>
  <li>1 medium shallot, finely minced
  <li>1 cup Marsala, red wine, dry sherry or anything of your choosing (this could be a fruit juice; if substituting a liquor like bourbon, cut the quantity in half)
  <li>Reduced brodo from above
  <li>1 stick unsalted butter, cold, cubed butter slightly softened
  <li>Sherry vinegar or a fruit jam, such as black currant (optional)
</ul>
 
<ol>
  <li>In heavy medium saucepan, heat 1 tablespoon butter over medium heat. As it begins to melt, add shallots and stir to coat. 
  <li>Sweat shallots 2-3 minutes until tender but not colored. Lower heat, if necessary.
  <li>Deglaze with the wine or liquid of choice and simmer until the liquid reduces by a third. Add the reduced brodo and cook until consistency is thickened slightly, to form a sauce.
  <li>Turn off heat and whisk in 1 tablespoon of butter at a time. Taste and continue adding more butter if desired.
  <li>Optional: At this time, a dash of sherry vinegar can be added to enliven the sauce or a dollop of a fruit puree, such as black or red currant jam to complement the roasted bird. This is your discretion. 
  <li>This sauce can be reheated gently (no boiling) if any is leftover.
</ol>

<strong>Tip:</strong> Save your rinds from Parmigiano-Reggiano in the freezer for making brodo. If you don’t have a cache on hand buy them at Whole Foods, Metropolitan market or ask for them at PCC. Use the real stuff, Italian Parmigiano-Reggiano!
