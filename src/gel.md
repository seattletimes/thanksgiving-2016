For a fun and fancy twist on cranberry sauce, Maximillian Petty, chef at Eden Hill, likes to create a fluid gel to garnish a turkey plate. Make a gel, put it in a squeeze bottle, and decorate to your heart’s content. Note: Agar agar is a vegan gelling agent derived from seaweed. It comes in powder and flake forms, so follow the instructions on the back of the container to make the hard gel.

Go for it
 
To really go all in, start by making your own cranberry juice. The juice can be sweetened to your liking and used for this, and cocktails if you have any leftovers. 

<strong>For the cranberry juice:</strong>
<ul>
  <li>4 cups fresh cranberries
  <li>4 cups water
  <li>½ cup fresh orange juice
  <li>½ cup lemon juice
  <li>½ cup simple syrup
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>Place water and cranberries in pot and bring to a boil. Simmer for 25 minutes, or until the cranberries begin to pop. 
  <li>Remove from heat and place in a food mill. Churn through the mill and place in a bowl. 
  <li>Add the orange juice and simple syrup. Season to your liking by adding more of either to reach the appropriate sweetness. 
  <li>Pass the mixture through a fine strainer, and chill the finished juice in the refrigerator. 
</ol>

<strong>To make the gel:</strong>
<ul>
  <li>1 quart of cranberry juice mixture
  <li>1.5 tablespoons agar agar (or follow the instructions on the package)
</ul>
 
<ol>
  <li>Place 1 quart of cranberry mixture in stainless steel pot. Whisk in agar until fully emulsified. Slowly bring to a simmer, and simmer for 3 minutes. 
  <li>Pour hot mixture in a pan to cool and set, about an hour. 
  <li>Once the juice has fully set, it should be like hard Jell-O. Place it in a blender in chunks and blend until a smooth gel is formed. If it is hard to spin, add a touch of the juice mixture to the blender to slightly thin it out. 
  <li>Once the gel is very smooth, place it in a squeeze bottle. Garnish your turkey and stuffing plate with dots of cranberry fluid.
</ol>

Simplify

To make the simple version of this recipe, start with a bottled cranberry juice. Note that some cranberry juices are completely unsweetened, and are quite tart. If you start with one of those, sweeten to your liking with simple syrup before making the gel. 

<strong>To make the gel:</strong>
<ul>
  <li>1 quart bottled cranberry juice
  <li>1.5 tablespoons agar agar (or follow the instructions on the package)
</ul>
 
<ol>
  <li>Place 1 quart of cranberry mixture in stainless steel pot. Whisk in agar until fully emulsified. Slowly bring to a simmer, and simmer for 3 minutes. 
  <li>Pour hot mixture in a pan to cool and set, about an hour. 
  <li>Once the juice has fully set, it should be like hard Jell-O. Place it in a blender in chunks and blend until a smooth gel is formed. If it is hard to spin, add a touch of the juice mixture to the blender to slightly thin it out.
