<em>Serves 6-8</em>

<strong>For chicken brodo base:</strong>
<ul>
  <li>1 gallon chicken stock, strained (this can be a homemade stock or store-bought; no bouillon!)
  <li>2 bone-in chicken thighs, skin and fat removed
  <li>2-6 ounces rind of Parmigiano-Reggiano
  <li>2 sprigs thyme
  <li>2 flat leaf parsley stems
  <li>½ medium yellow onion, cut in half, skin on
</ul>
 
<ol>
  <li>In a heavy sauce pot, heat stock, chicken thighs, cheese rinds, thyme, parsley and onion. Bring to a simmer. Skim impurities off the top and continue to cook at a low simmer for two hours. Skim off the top often.
  <li>Remove from heat and strain.  
  <li>Heat strained liquid over medium to medium-high heat and reduce to a simmer. Reduce the stock to approximately 1 ½  to 2 cups, about another hour. The liquid should be thickened, delicious and dark amber in color.
  <li>If it seems thick, you can add stock and continue to reduce, or adjust in the future. 
  <li>This sauce can be refrigerated or frozen at this stage, or turned into your finished sauce.
</ol>

<strong>For finished gravy:</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Drippings from the roasted bird
  <li>1 teaspoon champagne or sherry vinegar
  <li>1 sprig rosemary or thyme
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>When your turkey, or other bird, is done roasting, remove it from the pan, and pour the drippings into a bowl or measuring cup. Let the drippings sit, and skim the fat off the top. 
  <li>Use the chicken brodo base to deglaze the roasting pan over medium heat, scraping off small browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Add a splash of the vinegar and rosemary or thyme, and continue to make a classic gravy from here, adding in drippings to reach the desired consistency.
