To really go all in, start by making your own cranberry juice. The juice can be sweetened to your liking and used for this, and cocktails if you have any leftovers. 

<strong>For the cranberry juice:</strong>
<ul>
  <li>4 cups fresh cranberries
  <li>4 cups water
  <li>½ cup fresh orange juice
  <li>½ cup lemon juice
  <li>½ cup simple syrup
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>Place water and cranberries in pot and bring to a boil. Simmer for 25 minutes, or until the cranberries begin to pop. 
  <li>Remove from heat and place in a food mill. Churn through the mill and place in a bowl. 
  <li>Add the orange juice and simple syrup. Season to your liking by adding more of either to reach the appropriate sweetness. 
  <li>Pass the mixture through a fine strainer, and chill the finished juice in the refrigerator. 
</ol>

<strong>To make the gel:</strong>
<ul>
  <li>1 quart of cranberry juice mixture
  <li>1.5 tablespoons agar agar (or follow the instructions on the package)
</ul>
 
<ol>
  <li>Place 1 quart of cranberry mixture in stainless steel pot. Whisk in agar until fully emulsified. Slowly bring to a simmer, and simmer for 3 minutes. 
  <li>Pour hot mixture in a pan to cool and set, about an hour. 
  <li>Once the juice has fully set, it should be like hard Jell-O. Place it in a blender in chunks and blend until a smooth gel is formed. If it is hard to spin, add a touch of the juice mixture to the blender to slightly thin it out. 
  <li>Once the gel is very smooth, place it in a squeeze bottle. Garnish your turkey and stuffing plate with dots of cranberry fluid.
</ol>
