We always brine our birds first, which is the process of creating a salt solution that both seasons and breaks down the internal protein structure, which means the meat will be more tender. It takes some time and quite a bit of space, so remember to start early. If you prefer a dry brine option, check out the “simplify” version of this recipe. 

<ul>
  <li>1 fresh turkey
  <li>Kosher salt
  <li>White sugar
  <li>Assorted vegetables, such as celery, onion, carrot (optional)
</ul>

<div class="strong">For brining:</div>
<ol>
  <li>We use a 3 percent salt and 1.5 percent sugar by weight ratio. More simply put, for every 100 grams of water, we dissolve 3 grams of salt and 1.5 grams of sugar at a boil, then cool the solution.
 
  <li>Depending of the size of your bird, you will need a large container (like a clean 5-gallon bucket). Place the bird in the container, and place enough of the brine to cover the turkey (make sure the brine is cold). Keep the turkey in the brine, refrigerated, for 24-36 hours, longer if it's a larger turkey. Remove from brine and let it air dry in the refrigerator overnight (so be sure to start the process one day ahead). 
 
  <li>Pull the turkey a few hours ahead of roasting and place on the kitchen counter to allow the turkey to temper, which will allow more even cooking.
</ol>

<div class="strong">For spatchcocking:</div>

<ol>
  <li>Using poultry scissors, with the turkey breast-side down, cut along both sides of the backbone to remove. You can save the backbone for stock or for gravy (one of the downsides to this is you can't stuff the bird). 
 
  <li>Trim away any excess fat along the neck of the bird and discard. 
 
  <li>Flip the bird over, breast-side up, and using the palm of your hand, press down on the sternum of the turkey. You should hear the breast “pop” and the turkey should lay almost perfectly flat. 
 
  <li>Place the turkey on a roasting rack over a sheet pan. If you want, you can chop vegetables, such as onions, celery and carrot to place under the rack and catch the drippings. Use these vegetables for your gravy or stuffing, if you like.
 
  <li>Roast in a 400-degree oven for about 90 minutes — or until the breast reads 140 degrees and the legs read 150 degrees. Remove from the oven and let rest for one hour — the bird should continue to cook and reach an internal temperature of 150 degrees for the breast and 160 degrees for the legs. 
 
  <li>Carve and serve!
</ol>
