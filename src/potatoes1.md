<em>Serves 12</em>

<ul>
  <li>2 ⅔ pounds small Yukon Gold potatoes (golf-ball sized)
  <li>5 cups dashi (see epicurious.com’s Gourmet recipe)
  <li>⅓ cup sake
  <li>⅓ cup sugar
  <li>⅓ cup soy sauce
  <li>⅓ cup mirin
  <li>⅓ cup duck fat
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>Peel the potatoes and rinse.
  <li>Put the all the ingredients in a pot and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for approximately 1 hour, until potatoes are cooked through (test one with a fork). Remove potatoes with a slotted spoon and set aside.
  <li>Adjust heat to continue cooking liquid at a low boil until reduced into a glaze, approximately ½ hour to 45 minutes; stir at the end to prevent burning. 
  <li>Gently toss the potatoes in the glaze to coat, then transfer to serving bowl or platter, and drizzle remaining glaze over them.
