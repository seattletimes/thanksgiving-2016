<strong>Rustic Cranberry Tart</strong>
 
In France, these are known as gallettes; in Italy, crostata. The amount and kind of filling you put inside doesn’t have to be exact.

<ul>
  <li>1 recipe double-crust pie dough (pre-made, or your favorite will work, or make Kate McDermott’s recipe at artofthepie.com/1)

  <li>¾ cup sugar
  <li>1 ¼  teaspoons cornstarch
  <li>A pinch or small grating of freshly ground nutmeg
  <li>Pinch salt
  <li>½ teaspoon fresh orange zest or 1 tablespoon orange liqueur
  <li>Egg wash: 1 egg white plus 1 tablespoon water, fork-beaten
</ul>

<strong>To make the filling:</strong>

  <li>Place 1 ½ cups of the cranberries in a food processor and pulse until they are slightly chopped. In a medium bowl, place the chopped and remaining whole cranberries, sugar, cornstarch, nutmeg, salt and zest or liqueur, and mix well.
</ol>
 
<strong>To assemble the tart:</strong>
<ol>
  <li>Roll the dough out to about 14 inches (35 centimeters) in diameter and about a ¼-inch (.6-centimeter) thick and place on a parchment-covered sheet pan or cookie tin.
  <li>Spread pie filling in the middle of the dough, leaving a 2- to 3-inch (5- to 7-centimeter) border. 
  <li>Fold the edges of the dough up and over the filling and overlap, leaving an opening in the center.
  <li>Chill in the fridge or freezer for 30 minutes until the dough is firm. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.
  <li>Lightly brush some of the egg white wash over the edges, and sprinkle with some extra sugar.
  <li>Bake for 10 minutes, then turn the oven down to 375 degrees and bake for 30 minutes more, until golden brown.
