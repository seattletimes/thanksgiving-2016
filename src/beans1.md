<em>Serves 8</em>

<div class="strong">For the smoked heirloom beans:</div>
<ul>
  <li>⅔ cup heirloom beans, dried (your choice)
  <li>⅔ cup heirloom beans, dried (a second variety of your choice)
  <li>⅔ cup heirloom beans, dried (a third variety of your choice)
  <li>3 carrots (peel, leave whole, cut off tops)
  <li>3 celery stalks (leave whole, pick off leaves)
  <li>1 ½ yellow onions (peeled, cut in half and made into three skewers, so they don’t separate and float around)
  <li>3 sachet d’epices (bay leaf, thyme, parsley, black peppercorn, coriander, garlic)
  <li>Salt
  <li>Pepper
  <li>¼-½ teaspoon liquid smoke (optional, only necessary if you don’t have a smoker)
</ul>
 
<ol>
  <li>Soak beans overnight, in separate bowls.
  <li>Cook them separately in deep pans with twice as much liquid to beans. You want to cook them separately because each variety will be a slightly different size and you want to ensure perfect doneness.
  <li>Cover beans with water, and add carrot, celery, onion, garlic and sachet to each pan. Cover with foil and cook in oven at 300 degrees, about 2 hours, or until the beans are completely tender. 
  <li>When fully cooked, season beans with salt and pepper to taste, while leaving them in the liquid. (You have to season beans after they’re cooked. If you do it beforehand, they will remain crunchy.)
  <li>Strain beans, reserving liquid, and combine all three varieties. Smoke beans with apple wood chips in a hot smoker for 5 minutes on medium heat. (If you don’t own a smoker, stir in small amounts of liquid smoke in batches ¼ teaspoon or less at a time, until you reach the desired flavor. Liquid smoke is strong; don’t overdo it!)
  <li>Note: The prepared beans will hold in the refrigerator for at least 5 days. Keep them in their cooking liquid, to keep them from drying out.
</ol>

<div class="strong">For the truffle butter:</div>
<ul>
  <li>3 ½ ounces butter
  <li>1 ounce black truffle oil
  <li>1 ounce black truffle peelings
  <li>Salt
  <li>Pepper
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>Cut butter into chunks and let it soften.
  <li>Whip butter with a mixer, adding in truffle oil, truffle peelings, salt and pepper. 
</ol>

<div class="strong">For the finished dish:</div>
<ul>
  <li>¼ cup stale brioche
  <li>2 tablespoons canola oil
  <li>1 medium shallot, minced
  <li>2 cloves garlic, minced
  <li>1 cup wild mushrooms, julienned (whatever you like: oyster mushrooms, chanterelles, trumpets, etc.) 
  <li>1 tablespoon finely chopped chives
  <li>1 tablespoon finely chopped parsley
  <li>1 cup sun-dried tomatoes, julienned
  <li>Salt
  <li>Black pepper
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>Dry out stale brioche in oven until crispy, then pulverize in a food processor. Set aside. 
  <li>Clean and saute the mushrooms in canola oil, shallot and garlic. Add parsley, chives, tomatoes and the beans. Saute the whole mixture with a little bit of the reserved bean liquid, and the truffle butter. 
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>1 ounce truffle oil
  <li>Parsley
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>Transfer to a serving dish, and top with the brioche crumbs, truffle oil and parsley. 
</ol>
