To make the simple version of this recipe, start with a bottled cranberry juice. Note that some cranberry juices are completely unsweetened, and are quite tart. If you start with one of those, sweeten to your liking with simple syrup before making the gel. 

<div class="strong">For the gel:</div>
<ul>
  <li>1 quart bottled cranberry juice
  <li>1.5 tablespoons agar agar (or follow the instructions on the package)
</ul>
 
<ol>
  <li>Place 1 quart of cranberry mixture in stainless steel pot. Whisk in agar until fully emulsified. Slowly bring to a simmer, and simmer for 3 minutes. 
  <li>Pour hot mixture in a pan to cool and set, about an hour. 
  <li>Once the juice has fully set, it should be like hard Jell-O. Place it in a blender in chunks and blend until a smooth gel is formed. If it is hard to spin, add a touch of the juice mixture to the blender to slightly thin it out. 
  <li>Once the gel is very smooth, place it in a squeeze bottle. Garnish your turkey and stuffing plate with dots of cranberry fluid.
</ol>
