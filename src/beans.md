<div class="title">Heirloom Bean Cassoulet</div>
<div class="credit">— Maria Hines</div>

Chef Maria Hines, owner of Tilth, Agrodolce and Young American Ale House, says this vegetarian dish has become the most sought-after recipe at Tilth, as even meat lovers fawn over it. The comment she hears most: “How can you say this is vegetarian when there is meat in here?” The meaty, chewy texture of the mushrooms combined with the smoky beans gives the dish the illusion of meat. 

<div class="factbox">Note: People can buy the dish at Tilth over the holidays if they pre-order it two days in advance. We will send them home with instructions on how to heat and serve.</div>

Go for it

<strong>Note:</strong> This recipe will take two days to make. Start early! Or, see the “simplify” version, which can be done in one day.

<em>Serves 8</em>

<strong>For beans:</strong>
<ul>
  <li>⅔ cup heirloom beans, dried (your choice)
  <li>⅔ cup heirloom beans, dried (a second variety of your choice)
  <li>⅔ cup heirloom beans, dried (a third variety of your choice)
  <li>3 carrots (peel, leave whole, cut off tops)
  <li>3 celery stalks (leave whole, pick off leaves)
  <li>1.5 yellow onions (peeled, cut in half and made into three skewers, so they don’t separate and float around)
  <li>3 sachet d’epices (bay leaf, thyme, parsley, black peppercorn, coriander, garlic)
  <li>Salt
  <li>Pepper
  <li>¼-½ teaspoon liquid smoke (optional, only necessary if you don’t have a smoker)
</ul>
 
<strong>To prepare smoked heirloom beans:</strong>
<ol>
  <li>Soak beans overnight, in separate bowls.
  <li>Cook them separately in deep pans with twice as much liquid to beans. You want to cook them separately because each variety will be a slightly different size and you want to ensure perfect doneness.
  <li>Cover beans with water, and add carrot, celery, onion, garlic and sachet to each pan. Cover with foil and cook in oven at 300 degrees, about 2 hours, or until the beans are completely tender. 
  <li>When fully cooked, season beans with salt and pepper, to taste, while leaving them in the liquid. (You have to season beans after they’re cooked. If you do it beforehand, they will remain crunchy.)
  <li>Strain beans, reserving liquid, and combine all three varieties. Smoke beans with apple wood chips in a hot smoker for 5 minutes on medium heat. (If you don’t own a smoker, stir in small amounts of liquid smoke in batches ¼ teaspoon or less at a time, until you reach the desired flavor. Liquid smoke is strong; don’t overdo it!)
  <li>Note: The prepared beans will hold in the refrigerator for at least 5 days. Keep them in their cooking liquid, to keep them from drying out.
</ol>

<strong>Note:</strong> Finding canned heirloom beans may prove to be difficult. The goal here is to have a few different colors and sizes of beans for variety. If you can’t find heirloom, try a mixture of beans such as great northern, cannellini, pinto or kidney.
